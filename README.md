# React
It's a front-end library, but many people call it a framework. It doesn't have things like routing, but you can use packages to extend React and then, it becomes more like a framework.

The main point of React is creating **reusable components**.

You should have a relatively solid background in JavaScript.

It uses something called **Virtual Dom**. Components have something called **State**, and when a component's state changes, React compare existing dom with virtual one and changes it.

Main tools of React:
- Components
- Props
- State
- Events
