# React
It's a front-end library, but many people call it a framework. It doesn't have things like routing, but you can use packages to extend React and then, it becomes more like a framework.

The main point of React is creating **reusable components**.

You should have a relatively solid background in JavaScript.

It uses something called **Virtual Dom**. Components have something called **State**, and when a component's state changes, React compare existing dom with virtual one and changes it.

Main tools of React:
- Components
- Props
- State
- Events

# Install these

1. NodeJS
2. VSCode
3. git
4. React Developre Tools (browser extention)
5. Postman

You probably need to add the following line to `settings.json` for emmet to work in jsx.
```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
  "javascript": "javascriptreact",
}
```

#### Nice to have
Bracket Pair Colorizer (vscode extension)
